About the Project
This project implements a content-based recommendation system that suggests movies similar to a user-provided input. It uses text processing techniques to extract features from movie descriptions and compares their similarity scores to make recommendations.

Features
Content-based recommendations
Utilizes TF-IDF Vectorization for feature extraction
Calculates similarity scores using cosine similarity
Simple and efficient design
Dataset
The project uses a dataset containing movie information, such as titles and descriptions. The dataset is stored in a CSV file named movies.csv.
